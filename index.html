    <h2>About Kazem, A Physicist in the Universe!</h2>

    <p>
 It is past midnight and I am still dealing with my research! I have already spent too much time on that. It surely sounds disappointing! But if there is one thing that I am good at, it would be my tenacious, preserving personality! I would never give up on my tasks and dreams; even if that means repeating a procedure over and over again for a long time and losing hundreds of times. I lose hundreds of times to eventually win! One of the most important lessons I learned from doing and studying physics is to never submit to my problems and difficulties whether in physics research or in life! In my journey towards personal fulfillment, I harbor an aspiration deeply rooted in the core of my being, that is to infuse the world with novelty and to positively impact the course of humanity. I am determined to wield my background in physics as a vessel of change. I want to teach and guide the next generation of novel physicists and become a great physicist researcher (PhD and above). This is not merely a goal, but one of my life's chosen purposes. I believe it, someday I will become a great scientist who will change the world for good, I will not give up on my dream!

    <h3>Python The AC/DC The Josephson Junction Effect</h3>
    <img src="images/josp.png" alt="Project 4">
    <p>
        Superconducting phenomena are among the most fascinating features in physics, and the Josephson effect
is the most interesting of all. In 1962, Brian Josephson predicted that electron pairs could tunnel without
resistance through an insulating barrier between two superconductors. Here we use a point contact between
niobium wire with a thin oxide layer and a niobium block. Both the DC and AC Josephson effects are
observed and measured. A DC current can flow through the junction with no potential difference, but when
a DC voltage is applied together with a small alternating voltage, the I-V curve shows a characteristic step
structure. From this step structure, the value of 2e/h can be calculated easily and accurately, an exciting
consequence of the properties of the junction. The ratio e/h appears throughout atomic and condensed
matter physics. (Cited from 111B Website)

    <h3>Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)</h3>
    <img src="images/afmp.png" alt="Project 4">
    <p>
During our experimental work, we utilized a commercially available AFM unit and
conducted five distinct experiments. Initially, we focused on acquiring a deep understanding
of the AFM microscope and the various factors that influence its functioning.
We carefully examined both internal and environmental sources of noise and how they
impact the accuracy of the instrument. Following this, we shifted our focus to scanning
optical disks and employed the AFM to accurately measure the pit depths of
these disks, achieving a remarkable 20 percent accuracy rate. We also utilized the
phase drive scan technique to analyze the structure of a polymer sample in detail,
further refining our understanding of the AFM’s capabilities. Finally, we delved into
the F-D curve experiment and utilized it to estimate the Boltzmann constant with remarkable
precision, achieving a difference of merely 1 percent from the accepted value.
Through our efforts, we have gained a deeper appreciation for the versatile capabilities
of AFM units and the significant contribution they can make to scientific research.

    <h3>Rubidium Optical Pumping</h3>
    <img src="images/optp.png" alt="Project 5">
    <p>
This lab report aimed to investigate and calculate various parameters related to Rubidium
atoms, including the ambient magnetic field, and nuclear spin values. Through
data analysis and calculations, the ambient field for Rb87 was found to be (-0.4282 ±
0.004)G and for Rb85 to be (-0.4352 ± 0.006)G, which matches well with the accepted
range for the value of the earth’s magnetic field. The nuclear spin values for Rb85
and Rb87 were determined to be 2.539 ± 0.004 and 1.532 ± 0.006, respectively, which
closely resemble the perfect ratios of 5/2 and 3/2. Finally, the optical pumping phenomenon
was explained, with Rubidium’s electron configuration and our tools. These
results demonstrate the success of the experimental measurements and calculations in
accurately determining important parameters of Rubidium atoms. Throughout this
experiment, we have acquired a wealth of knowledge in several areas of physics, particularly
in the field of quantum mechanics. Our observations have allowed us to directly
witness the existence and behavior of quantum mechanics in action.

    <h3>Quantum Interference Entanglement</h3>
    <img src="images/qiep.png" alt="Project 6">
    <p>
        Entanglement has been one of the most counterintuitive
phenomena discovered in nature! The idea was
first introduced into physics by the famous trio: Einstein,
Podolsky, and Rosen (the name EPR comes from here!).
It was a striking non-classical result of quantum mechanics!
The idea is simple enough, yet hard to believe! Hence
many theories and ideas were developed against this phenomenon.
As Einstein described it as “spooky action at
a distance!”. Hence in 1935, the three good friends Einstein,
Podolsky, and Rosen in an attempt against quantum
mechanics developed and formed a theory in which
they claimed that there are some missing and unconsidered
variables in this quantum mechanics that arise from
these counterintuitive properties in nature. Eventually,
they published a paper which is now goes by the name
of “Hidden variable theory” or from now on HVT for
short! In 1964 John Bell showed that the “locality hypothesis”
with HVT leads to a conflict with quantum
mechanics. He postulated a mathematical theorem consisting
of specific inequalities. The observation of a violation
of these inequalities through experimentation would
indicate the existence of nonlocality in states that are
in favor of quantum mechanics and against the HVT! In
this experiment, we went through the same procedure.
